Despite our name, we make more utilities than games.

We are a relatively small organisation, and do small and simple things.

Our aim is to provide compact, compatible, but modern applications to users, giving purpose back to older hardware.

Check out one of our best products: [Little Music Player](https://martinmimigames.github.io/projects/little-music-player).

We welcome any contributions to our products.

More detail can be found in [our official website](https://martinmimigames.github.io).
