# martinmimigames

Despite our name, we make more than games.

We are a relatively small organisation, and do small and simple things.

Our aim is to provide compact, compatible, but modern applications to users, giving purpose back to older hardwares.

Great example of our aim is presented in our product [little music player](https://martinmimigames.github.io/projects/little-music-player).

We welcome any contribution.

More detail can be found in [our official website](https://martinmimigames.github.io).
